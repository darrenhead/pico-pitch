# README Update Reminder for PicoSeed

- If new environment variables are added, ensure they are documented in `README.md` and a sample `.env.example` file.
- If the setup process changes, update the setup instructions in `README.md`.
- If new major features or agents are added, briefly describe them and their usage in `README.md`.
- After completing a major development phase (as outlined in the project plan), review and update the relevant sections of `README.md`.
