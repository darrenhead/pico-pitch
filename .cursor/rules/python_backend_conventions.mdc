# PicoSeed Python Backend Conventions

- **Python Version:** Assume Python 3.9+
- **Virtual Environment:** All development should occur within a Python virtual environment (`venv`). Dependencies are managed in `requirements.txt`.
- **Type Hinting:** Use Python type hints extensively for better code clarity and maintainability.
- **Main Orchestrator:** The `orchestrator.py` script is the central point for managing the workflow.
- **Agent Structure:** Python agents (e.g., `reddit_scraper_agent.py`, `gemini_interaction_agent.py`) should be modular and focus on specific tasks.
- **PRAW Usage:** When interacting with Reddit via PRAW:
    - Respect API rate limits (use `time.sleep()`).
    - Handle potential PRAW exceptions gracefully.
    - Ensure the `user_agent` is correctly set for the Reddit client.
- **File Exporter:** The `file_exporter.py` module (or equivalent logic) is responsible for saving Markdown files locally.
