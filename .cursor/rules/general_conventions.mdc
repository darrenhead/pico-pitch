# PicoSeed General Conventions

- **Project Goal:** PicoSeed is an AI-driven system to find SaaS opportunities from Reddit, analyze them with Gemini, and generate development plans.
- **Modularity:** Strive for modular code. Break down complex logic into smaller, reusable functions or classes.
- **Clarity:** Prioritize clear and readable code. Add comments where necessary to explain complex logic or intent.
- **File Naming:** Use `snake_case` for Python files and `kebab-case` or `PascalCase` (for components) for Next.js files.
- **Version Control:** Commit messages should be clear and follow conventional commit formats if possible (e.g., `feat: ...`, `fix: ...`, `docs: ...`).
- **Secrets Management:** All API keys (Reddit, Gemini, Supabase) and sensitive configurations MUST be loaded from environment variables (e.g., via a `.env` file locally, and environment variables in deployment). Do NOT hardcode secrets.
- **Output Directory:** Generated Markdown documents (BRDs, PRDs, Agile Plans) should be saved to the `outputs/picoseed_outputs/[opportunity_id]/[document_type]_v[version].md` directory structure.
